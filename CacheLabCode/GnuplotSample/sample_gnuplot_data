# Sample data file for gnu plot

# The first column are x values.
# The remaining columns are the y-values for the different lines drawn.

#   line1   line2  line3  
1    10      10      2    
2    5       9       3    
4    2       8       4    
8    3       7       3    
16   4       8       2    

# To generate the plot, launch gnuplot, then enter the following command:

# plot "sample_gnuplot_data" using 1:2 with linespoints title "First Line", "sample_gnuplot_data" using 1:3 with linespoints title "Second Line", "sample_gnuplot_data" using 1:4 with linespoints title "Third Line"
#
# Since the block sizes are powers of two, you might want to run this command before running the plot command "set logscale x"
